# Submit Behavior

## Overview  
When a form is submitted, it’s important to provide feedback that the server is processing the request. Superforms offers configuration options to control form behavior during and after submission, ensuring a smooth user experience with loading timers and submission handling.

---

## Usage  
Configure submission behavior using the `superForm` hook with the `clearOnSubmit` and `multipleSubmits` options:  

```javascript
const { form, enhance } = superForm(data.form, {
  clearOnSubmit: 'message' | 'errors' | 'errors-and-message' | 'none' = 'message',
  multipleSubmits: 'prevent' | 'allow' | 'abort' = 'prevent'
});
```

---

## `clearOnSubmit`  
Controls what is cleared after submission:  

### Options  
- **`'message'` (default):** Clears the status message.  
- **`'errors'`:** Clears all form errors.  
- **`'errors-and-message'`:** Clears both errors and messages.  
- **`'none'`:** Retains errors and messages (prevents DOM layout shifts).  

### Example  
```javascript
// Clear only errors after submission  
superForm(data.form, { clearOnSubmit: 'errors' });
```

---

## `multipleSubmits`  
Manages repeated submissions before a response is received:  

### Options  
- **`'prevent'` (default):** Disables resubmission until a response or timeout occurs.  
- **`'abort'`:** Cancels the ongoing request and sends a new one.  
- **`'allow'`:** Permits unlimited submissions (e.g., for real-time forms).  

### Example  
```javascript
// Allow multiple submissions (use with caution)  
superForm(data.form, { multipleSubmits: 'allow' });
```

---

## Key Considerations  
- **Loading Timers:** Submissions trigger loading states until a response is received (see [Loading Timers](#loading-timers) for details).  
- **DOM Stability:** Use `clearOnSubmit: 'none'` to avoid layout shifts caused by dynamic content removal.

## When to Use Each Option  
| Scenario                          | Recommended Setting               |  
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|  
| Prevent form "double-click" issues | `multipleSubmits: 'prevent'`     |  
| Real-time form updates            | `multipleSubmits: 'abort'`       |  
| Static forms with no dynamic UI    | `clearOnSubmit: 'none'`          |  

---

## Default Behavior  
- **`clearOnSubmit` defaults to `'message'`**, removing success/error messages after submission.  
- **`multipleSubmits defaults to `'prevent'`**, blocking duplicate submissions until the server responds.  

For advanced use cases, adjust these options to align with your application’s needs.
