# TanStack Table v8 Documentation

## Overview
TanStack Table is a headless UI library designed to handle the logic, state, and processing required for building powerful tables and data grids in TypeScript/JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, Solid, Qwik, and Svelte. It focuses on providing core functionality while allowing full control over presentation and styling.

---

## What is "Headless" UI?
Headless UI libraries abstract complex logic (e.g., data processing, state management) into reusable APIs, decoupling them from UI implementation. This allows developers to focus on customizing the presentation layer.

### Key Principles:
- **Logic First**: Manages data processing, sorting, filtering, and pagination.
- **Markup Freedom**: No enforced UI components‚Äîbuild your own table structure.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any framework via adapters (e.g., `@tanstack/svelte-table`).

---

## Component-Based vs. Headless Libraries

### Component-Based Table Libraries (e.g., AG Grid)
**Pros**:
- Ready-to-use components with built-in styles and themes.
- Minimal setup required for basic use cases.
- Often include advanced features out-of-the-box.

**Cons**:
- Less control over markup and styling.
- Larger bundle sizes due to included UI components.
- Tightly coupled to specific frameworks or platforms.

### Headless Table Libraries (e.g., TanStack Table)
**Pros**:
- Lightweight and modular architecture.
- Full control over HTML/CSS implementation.
- Portable across frameworks and platforms.

**Cons**:
- Requires more setup to integrate with existing UI.
- No default styling or themes provided.

---

## Which Library Should I Choose?

### Use a Component-Based Library If:
- You need a "drop-in" solution with pre-built UI.
- Design consistency and speed of implementation are priorities.
- Framework-specific optimizations are critical.

**Example**: AG Grid is ideal for enterprise applications requiring pre-styled grids and advanced features.

### Use a Headless Library If:
- You need full control over table markup and styling.
- You want to minimize bundle size.
- You‚Äôre building a custom or highly branded interface.

**Example**: TanStack Table excels in scenarios where you want to pair table logic with a custom design system.

---

## Key Features of TanStack Table
- **Column Definitions**: Define columns with `columnDef` objects for headers, accessors, and metadata.
- **State Management**: Built-in state for sorting, filtering, and pagination.
- **Virtualization**: Optimize rendering for large datasets.
- **Framework Adapters**: Official adapters for React, Svelte, and more.

---

## Example Usage (Svelte Adapter)
```svelte
<script>
  import { createTable } from '@tanstack/svelte-table';

  const columns = [
    { accessorKey: 'name', header: 'Name' },
    { accessorKey: 'age', header: 'Age' }
  ];

  const data = [
    { name: 'Alice', age: 30 },
    { name: 'Bob', age 25 }
  ];

  const table = createTable({
    data,
    columns
  });
</script>

<table>
  <thead>
    {#each table.getHeaderGroups() as headerGroup}
      <tr>
        {#each headerGroup.headers as header}
          <th>{@html header.render()}</th>
        {/each}
      </tr>
    {/each}
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {#each table.getRowModel().rows as row}
      <tr>
        {#each row.getVisibleCells() as cell}
          <td>{@html cell.render()}</td>
        {/each}
      </tr>
    {/each}
  </tbody>
</table>
```

---

## Why Choose TanStack Table?
- **Lightweight**: Focuses solely on table logic.
- **Flexible**: Works with any UI framework or design system.
- **Extensible**: Add custom features via plugins or adapters.

### Key Concepts Explained
- **Headless UI**: Focuses on logic, not presentation.
- **Column Definitions**: Define columns with `accessorKey` and `header` properties.
- **State Management**: Built-in state for sorting, filtering, and pagination.

### Comparison Summary
| **Aspect**               | **Component-Based Libraries** | **Headless Libraries** |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Setup Complexity**      | Low                          | High                  |
| **Customization**         | Limited                      | Full                  |
| **Bundle Size**           | Larger                       | Smaller               |
| **Use Case**             | Quick implementation          | Custom design systems |

---

## Getting Started
1. **Install**: `npm install @tanstack/svelte-table`
2. **Define Columns**: Specify columns with accessors and headers.
3. **Render Data**: Use the table instance to generate rows and headers.

---

## FAQ
**Q: Can I use TanStack with CSS frameworks like Tailwind?**  
A: Yes! Apply classes directly to your custom table elements.

**Q: How does sorting work?**  
A: Use `table.getSortedRowModel()` to get sorted data based on column sort states.

### Example: Global Filtering
```svelte
<script>
  const table = createTable({
    data,
    columns,
    state: {
      globalFilter: ''
    },
    enableSorting: true
  });
</script>

<input bind:value={table.getState().globalFilter} placeholder="Search..." />
```

---

### Example: Column Pinning
```svelte
{#each table.getHeaderGroups() as headerGroup}
  <tr>
    {#each headerGroup.headers as header}
      {#if header.isPinnedLeft}
        <th style="position: sticky; left: 0">{header.render()}</th>
      {:else if header.isPinnedRight}
        <th style="position: sticky; right: 0">{header.render()}</th>
      {:else}
        <th>{@html header.render()}</th>
      {/if}
    {/each}
  </tr>
{/each}
```

---

### Example: Virtualization
```svelte
{#each table.getVirtualizedRowModel() as row}
  <tr>{/* Render row */}</tr>
{/each}
```

### Troubleshooting
**Issue**: "My table isn't rendering data."
**Solution**: Ensure `data` is passed to `createTable` and columns match your data structure.

**Issue**: "How do I style sorted columns?"
**Solution**: Use `header.column.getIsSorted()` to conditionally apply styles.
