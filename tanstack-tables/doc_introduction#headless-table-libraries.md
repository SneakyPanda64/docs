# TanStack Table v8 Documentation

## Overview
TanStack Table is a headless UI library for building powerful tables and datagrids for TypeScript/JavaScript, supporting frameworks like React, Vue, Solid, Qwik, and Svelte. It focuses on providing logic, state management, and data processing, allowing full control over markup and styling.

---

## What is "Headless" UI?
Headless UI libraries provide logic and state management without enforcing specific UI components or styles. Key goals of headless UI include:
- Simplifying complex tasks like data processing and state management.
- Decoupling logic from UI implementation for greater modularity.
- Enabling customization of design and styling patterns (CSS, CSS-in-JS, etc.).
- Portability across any JavaScript environment.

---

## Component-Based vs. Headless Libraries

### Component-Based Table Libraries
**Examples**: AG Grid  
**Pros**:
- Ready-to-use components with pre-built styles and themes.
- Minimal setup required.
- Turn-key solutions for common table use cases.

**Cons**:
- Less control over markup and styling.
- Larger bundle sizes due to included UI components.
- Tight coupling to specific frameworks or platforms.

---

### Headless Table Libraries
**Example**: TanStack Table  
**Pros**:
- Full control over UI markup and styling.
- Smaller bundle sizes (no pre-built UI components).
- Portable across any JavaScript environment.

**Cons**:
- Requires more setup to integrate with existing UI.
- No default styling or themes provided.

---

## Choosing the Right Library

### When to Use a Component-Based Library?
- Prioritize **speed of implementation** over customization.
- Need pre-built UI components and themes.
- Accept trade-offs in bundle size and design control.

### When to Use a Headless Library?
- Need **full control over UI and styling**.
- Prefer modular, lightweight solutions.
- Want to integrate with existing design systems or frameworks.

---

## Recommendations
- **For component-based needs**: AG Grid is recommended as a leading choice.
- **For headless needs**: TanStack Table is the preferred solution.
