### Key Notes:
1. **Structure**: Organized into clear sections with headers and code blocks for type definitions.
2. **Examples**: Retained all original examples (e.g., `Header<TData>[]`).
3. **Navigation**: Added a table of contents (`On this page`) for easy reference.
4. **Formatting**: Used Markdown syntax for code blocks, links, and headers.
5. **Sanitization**: Removed unrelated content (privacy policy, menu items, partner info) while preserving technical details.
6. **Contextual Links**: Included a GitHub link placeholder and version/framework references as per the original text.
7. **Clarity**: Added a note about versioning and framework context to align with the original context of "TanStack Table v8" and "Svelte".
